# Pricing and Calibrating Financial Derivatives using TensorFlow
## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating 
financial derivatives pricing models using TensorFlow, 
a popular deep learning platform. The core of this 
research lies in leveraging TensorFlow's Automatic 
Differentiation (AD) capabilities to enhance the 
efficiency and precision of financial models, 
particularly in the domain of quantitative finance.

## Objective
- To explore the application of deep learning platforms,
specifically TensorFlow, for pricing and calibrating 
financial derivatives.
- To investigate the efficiency of AD in handling 
high-dimensional gradient calculations and its impact
on the calibration of pricing or risk models in finance.
- To emphasize the performance evaluation in terms 
of computational speed and accuracy, with a special 
focus on Monte Carlo methods and models that involve 
a large number of calibration parameters.

## Background
Programming platforms like TensorFlow and PyTorch have
revolutionized the field of deep learning through 
efficient gradient calculations in high-dimensional 
spaces, thanks to built-in AD capabilities. 
Backpropagation, a form of AD, is crucial in these 
computations. In quantitative finance, the calibration
of models to market data often relies on gradient 
descent methods, but the adoption of AD in financial 
modeling, especially in large banks, has been slow. 
This project aims to bridge this gap by demonstrating 
the effectiveness of AD in financial modeling.

## Methodology
- Implement financial derivatives pricing models using
TensorFlow.
- Test models for speed and precision, comparing AD 
methods with traditional non-AD approaches.
- Focus on Monte Carlo methods and models with extensive
calibration parameters.
